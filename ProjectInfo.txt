'0' = Stop
'8' = Up
'2' = Down
'4' = Left
'6' = Right
'A' = Auto Grab
'B' = Auto Release 
'C' = Grab
'D' = Release
'E' = Rotate Left
'F' = Rotate Right




CONTROLS:
Release - 	Release the rover into autonomous mode
Grab    - 	Grab the rover back into manual mode
Rotate Left - 	Toggle wall alignmment function





High-level functions we have in the program:

void turnLeft()	-- Turn 90 degrees
void turnRight()

float getLeftDistance()		-- These will turn the servo automatically if necessary
float getForwardsDistance()



Auto behaviour (basic behaviour, will need to change this after testing):

- START
- Start moving forwards
- Check left. If there is a passage left, stop, turn left, go back to START
- Check forwards. If there is no room left, stop, turn right, go back to START

- If ever there is no ping, maybe move forwards a bit, left a bit, right a bit, until there is a ping?
